/**
 * <p>Deletes the specified role. Unlike the Amazon Web Services Management Console, when you delete a role
 *             programmatically, you must delete the items attached to the role manually, or the
 *             deletion fails. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage_delete.html#roles-managingrole-deleting-cli">Deleting an IAM role</a>. Before attempting to delete a role, remove the
 *             following attached items: </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Inline policies (<a>DeleteRolePolicy</a>)</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Attached managed policies (<a>DetachRolePolicy</a>)</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Instance profile (<a>RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile</a>)</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Optional â€“ Delete instance profile after detaching from role for
 *                     resource clean up (<a>DeleteInstanceProfile</a>)</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the role you
 *                 are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with a
 *                 running instance will break any applications running on the instance.</p>
 *          </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IAMClient, DeleteRoleCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IAMClient, DeleteRoleCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iam"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IAMClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteRoleCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteRoleCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteRoleCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IAMClientResolvedConfig | config} for IAMClient's `config` shape.
